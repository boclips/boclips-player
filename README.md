BoPlayer is a framework agnostic video player which serves to play Boclips supplied videos on all our supported devices. It will feature core functionality that is expected of modern video players, such as analytics, closed captions, and adaptive bit rate streaming.

It will be integrated into other apps used by our API partners. We want to provide these partners with a complete player solution that allows us to gain insights to how our consumers watch our videos.

## Usage
